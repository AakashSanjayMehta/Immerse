    "One of the early milestones you would face as an SST student is chosing a CCA. Since the cohort is a small one, we are told that the school will start new CCAs only if there is a sizeable number of interested students. But the truth is that our students have no problems finding a CCA that either helps to hone current skills and interests or uncover a hidden talent or passion. ",
    
    "During the CCA tryouts, students are given the opportunity to attend any CCA session of their choice during a two-week trial period. Following the trial period, students would then indicate their preferred choice of CCA for the rest of their 4 years in SST. ",
    
    "I had a hard time choosing but eventually went with my heart in choosing showchoir. Showchoir is a performings arts CCA in SST. Other categories are Sports and Games, Clubs and Societies and Uniform groups. ",
    
    "I had seen clips of my seniors performing and was in awe.üò≤I‚Äôm finding out that getting to those standards of performance took a lot of effort and practice, not to mention team work. But as they say,‚ÄùNo pain, no gain.‚Äù. I want to gain the confidence to express myself and the strength to endure tough situations. So I‚Äôll break a leg, not literally of course. üòÑ"
